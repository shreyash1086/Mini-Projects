## The-Pokemon 
This is a Pokemon Card Generator Application  
This App takes No of Cards from the User as an Input and Display Random Pokemon Card

I have Used `https://pokeapi.co/` Site to get the Details Of the Pokemon

To get the Details of the Pokemon I Sent HTTP request Through Axios Library Which is a Suger Coated Fetch Function Used to Send HTTP requests.

Sent HTTP request over to API `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}` to collect Information of Pokemon Based on their `id`.  

The `id` here is a randomly generated number which Helps Fetching Random Pokemons Data

### Learnings
- Learned DOM manipulation in Depth Building New Dynamic Elements Everytime User Sent request to Api;
- Also build a `CANVA` template as a reference to the web site
- Performed Styling through Plain `CSS`
