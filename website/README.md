# VS Code Landing Page
#### I have build the clone of a VS Code Webs site which is a completly static web page.   
Static Web pages are created only for the reading purpose.  
This Static page helped me learning the new properties of CSS while writting the HTML was easy.  
#### My Learnings :   
              1) Aligning the Blocks in the horizontal and vertical mannner with the help of { Display , Justify-Content } Properties.  
              2) Learned how to create a HTML file Structure for the Web page.
